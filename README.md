# SQL-Analytics
🚖 Namma Yatri Analytics & Dashboard
This repository contains a replication of Namma Yatri's ride analytics, where I used dummy data to simulate real-world ride-hailing transactions. The project showcases SQL-based data analysis and a Power BI dashboard for insightful visualizations.

📌 Project Overview
The project is structured in two major parts:

SQL Analysis: From basic querying to advanced window functions, optimizing insights on rides, earnings, and user behavior.

Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visualizations for ride trends, driver performance, peak-hour analysis, and more.

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
SQL: MySQL (Used for data extraction, transformation, and advanced analytics)

Power BI: Dashboarding & visualization

Dummy Data: Structured to replicate real-world ride-hailing scenarios

🔍 SQL Queries & Analysis
✔ Basic to Advanced SQL: Filtering, Joins, Aggregations
✔ Window Functions: Running totals, Rank, Lead/Lag for trend analysis
✔ Revenue & Performance Metrics: Driver earnings, customer behavior, peak-hour analysis
✔ Anomaly Detection: Identifying inconsistencies in ride data

📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
✔ Ride Trends Analysis – Number of rides per day, peak hour identification
✔ Driver Performance Metrics – Earnings, trip completion rates
✔ User Engagement Insights – Repeat customers, ride frequency
✔ Geo-based Ride Distribution – Heatmap of ride locations
